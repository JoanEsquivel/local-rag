Commands to document: 

pytest test_response_relevancy.py -s  


I needed to run this export command to be able to run the tests since the tests are in a different folder than the package:

export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}://Users/joanesquivel/Desktop/personalRag"
This is the explanation of the command: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-fix-modulenotfounderror-and-importerror-248ce5b69b1c/
